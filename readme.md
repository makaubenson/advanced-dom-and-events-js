# Advanced DOM and Events

## How the DOM Really Works

- DOM is the interface between our js code and our browser.

### What is DOM

- DOM allows us to:
- Make js interact with the browser
- Create, modify and delete html elements

- DOM tree is generated from an HTML document, which we can then interact with.
- DOM is a very complex API that contains lots of methods and properties to interact with the DOM tree.

### How DOM is organized behind the scenes

- Every single node in DOM tree is of type node.
- Each node is represented in js by the object which has access to different methods and properties.
- Node type ha child types: `element`, `text`, `comment`, `document`

#### Inheritance

- Each child types has access to each method and properties of the parent node types.

### Selecting, creating, and deleting elements

#### Selecting the whole document

```

console.log(document.documentElement);
//Selecting the head section
console.log(document.head);
//Selecting the body section
console.log(document.body);

//Using query selectpr
document.querySelector('.header');
const allSections = document.querySelectorAll('.section');
console.log(allSections);

//getElementById()
document.getElementById('section--1');


// getElementsByTagName()
const allButtons = document.getElementsByTagName('button');
console.log(allButtons);

//getElementsByClassName
console.log(document.getElementsByClassName('btn'));
```

- Both `getElementsByClassName()` and `getElementsByTagName()` returns a htmlcollection.
- `getElementById()` returns a nodelist
